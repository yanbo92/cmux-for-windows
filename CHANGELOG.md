# Changelog

All notable changes to the independently maintained Windows fork are documented here. This changelog does not describe releases of the upstream macOS project.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and version numbers follow the Windows package manifest.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Added a GitHub Actions iteration artifact containing the Windows GNU `cmux-tui.exe` and `cmux_ffi.dll` binaries for remote testing without a local build toolchain.
- Added structured `remote-probe --json` diagnostics and an experimental Windows `remote-link --stdio` server using upstream protocol 5, Noise authentication, and a bridge to the local headless mux.
- Added a Windows executable integration test that completes the remote handshake and issues a mux control request; documented the Actions → MacBook Air download → internal SCP → VDI testing loop.
- Mapped the Mac SSH frontend's fixed Unix default-shell bootstrap to the native Windows shell while preserving all other explicit command arguments.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Kept terminal keyboard focus when an in-app agent notification appears, is dismissed, or focuses its session.
- Restored ordinary English and other direct keyboard-layout characters while retaining committed IME text input, and preserved UTF-16 surrogate pairs plus `WM_UNICHAR` scalars for emoji and supplementary CJK.
- Restored terminal wheel scrolling by rendering each WinUI view's local scrollback position and accumulating high-precision wheel deltas.
- Fixed the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex launch shims and restored-session commands so Windows PowerShell preserves provider options and argument separators.
- Fixed a startup failure that left no window at all: an unread agent notification whose terminal had since been closed made every later launch abandon the saved session. Such notifications now stay in the history without blocking the restore, and existing state recovers without being discarded.
- Waited for the departing instance to hand over its workspace session instead of failing the launch, so relaunching while the previous window is still shutting down opens normally.
- Reported a failed launch instead of vanishing: the engine now names why a session could not be opened, the app shows that reason and the log path, and unhandled exceptions reach the log.
- Kept a launch that could not start its terminal, or a folder handed to an already-running window, from taking the whole app down.
- Raised an already-running window from the taskbar when a second launch hands it a folder, rather than leaving it minimized.
- Stopped concurrent cmux processes from silently dropping each other's log lines.

### Changed

- Slowed background topology polling while the window is inactive and stopped reallocating the snapshot buffer on every poll.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Added local Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex lifecycle integrations that display working, attention, idle, and completed state without reading terminal content.
- Added in-app completion and attention notifications that focus the exact workspace, screen, pane, and terminal tab by stable terminal identity without sending Windows system notifications.

### Fixed

- Restored each persistent terminal in its last validated local working directory using a new ConPTY process, with a safe home-directory fallback when the path is unavailable.
- Resumed hook-confirmed Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex provider sessions after GUI restart while continuing to discard process state, output, scrollback, and arbitrary command lines.
- Aligned the resource CLI's agent state vocabulary with the Rust core's `working`, `blocked`, `idle`, `done`, and `unknown` protocol values.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Added terminal `Ctrl+V` paste alongside the existing paste shortcuts.
- Routed committed Windows input-method text through the native text services so Chinese and other non-English input methods work in terminal panes.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Added a centralized Windows shortcut catalog covering workspace, screen, pane, tab, browser, and terminal actions, including position selection for the first ten workspaces, screens, and tabs.
- Added a package-free shortcut regression executable and Windows CI coverage for every defined action, exact modifier/context matching, AltGr exclusion, and destructive-key repeat protection.

### Fixed

- Routed application shortcuts before terminal and WebView input, while preserving text input in address/search fields, Settings, modal dialogs, and Right Alt/AltGr layouts.
- Completed terminal physical-key forwarding for OEM and international punctuation, left/right modifiers, Windows/Super, lock state, system keys, function/navigation keys, and numpad variants, including press, repeat, release, and focus-reset behavior.
- Cleared stale native character suppression when the active workspace input target changes, preventing delayed character messages from being dropped.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- Replaced run-shaped terminal text with native DirectWrite/Direct2D per-grapheme grid rendering, preserving Ghostty's one- and two-cell placement across fallback fonts, CJK, emoji, box drawing, bold, and italic text.
- Published physical cell metrics to the Rust mux so ConPTY pixel geometry follows the WinUI renderer at the current display DPI.

### Fixed

- Kept block-cursor glyphs readable, honored steady and blinking cursor modes and blinking text, applied complete inverse colors, and rendered selection foreground/background colors from the active mux theme.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Kept workspace views mounted across navigation and restored terminal polling after internal reparenting so Explorer launches, workspace and terminal-tab switches, and topology refreshes accept input without a reload gap or extra click.
- Hid the mounted workspace surface while Settings is open so terminal output does not show through the transparent settings page.
- Preselected split panes from the foreground left-button signal, observed handled terminal-body pointer presses at the pane boundary, and kept pane-focus-only snapshot changes out of topology reconstruction so immediate input reaches the clicked pane without a delayed tab rebuild reclaiming focus.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Reserved explicit settings-card action widths so color controls, image actions, switches, and selectors remain fully visible when the window is maximized.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Kept settings controls within the visible page width when resizing or maximizing the window.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Added optional first-level Windows 11 Explorer commands for opening a folder in a new cmux window or new cmux workspace, backed by a native `IExplorerCommand` server and signed sparse identity package, while retaining classic folder verbs for Windows 10.

### Changed

- Reduced the repository to the native Windows GUI, Windows-compatible Rust engine and TUI, required Ghostty source, Windows CI, and supporting documentation.
- Rewrote project documentation to identify `sweetcornna` as the independent maintainer and to make the fork's unsupported relationship to Manaflow explicit.
- Added the same independent-fork disclosure, project link, and installed-notice guidance to the localized GUI About section.
- Included direct Ghostty and vendored Rust license texts in the Windows installer payload.
- Replaced the placeholder Windows icons and title-bar glyph with authoritative upstream cmux artwork across every Win32 ICO frame, executable, installer shortcut, package, taskbar, and Explorer command; Setup now removes the obsolete full development MSIX that could leave a duplicate stale Windows Search entry.
- Reconciled volatile snapshot updates without rebuilding unchanged pane controls, corrected action-button icon clipping, and moved split dragging to an accessible native WinUI thumb.
- Standardized screen and pane action buttons at 30 DIP and replaced the active pane's blue outline with the neutral pane border while retaining logical focus behavior.
- Applied Ghostty themes and custom terminal foreground/background colors through mux-wide defaults so visible, hidden, restored, and newly created terminals update consistently, including immediate restoration of the Ghostty baseline when following the config again; custom shell accents now update bound actions and settings controls through one shared live brush.
- Resynchronized and repainted terminal canvases after split, zoom, unzoom, close, and other host reparenting operations to prevent stale backing surfaces from stretching terminal output.
- Deferred Win2D canvas attachment until a terminal host finishes loading, preventing newly created terminal tabs from remaining blank when WinUI delivers an early unmatched unload event.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Per-user Inno Setup installer with Start menu integration, optional desktop shortcut, uninstall registration, and SHA-256 sidecar.
- Installer upgrade repair for previously enabled Explorer context-menu integration.

### Changed

- Published the WinUI application and Rust engine as a self-contained Windows installation.
- Preserved user settings and durable workspace state during uninstall.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Native WinUI 3 frontend backed by the Rust multiplexer through `cmux_ffi.dll`.
- ConPTY terminal sessions with keyboard and mouse input.
- Workspaces, splits, pane tabs, focus handling, and durable workspace topology.
- Ghostty-compatible colors, fonts, palettes, bundled themes, background images, and appearance settings.
- English and Simplified Chinese localization.
- Optional Explorer context-menu integration.
- Development MSIX packaging support.

### Security

- Prevented terminal key and character content from being written to diagnostics.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Native Windows support for the Rust TUI and local resource CLI using the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target.
- ConPTY process hosting, Windows AF_UNIX control sockets, Windows state/config paths, and platform-specific shell selection.
