# cmux for Windows

A native Windows terminal workspace built with WinUI 3, ConPTY, Rust, and Ghostty's terminal engine.

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Highlights

- Native WinUI 3 desktop interface for Windows 10 version 2004 or newer.
- Real Windows pseudoterminals through ConPTY.
- Workspaces, screens, draggable split panes, and terminal and WebView2 browser tabs.
- Native keyboard, mouse, high-precision scrollback scrolling, selection, clipboard, pane-focus, and pane-zoom interactions with uniformly sized compact action buttons and neutral pane borders.
- DirectWrite/Direct2D terminal rendering that shapes each Ghostty grapheme inside its assigned one- or two-cell grid span, including readable block cursors, selection colors, text blink, and color-font fallback.
- Stable live terminal and browser controls during pane and workspace switches, topology polling, and split-layout changes, with inactive terminal rendering paused and selected terminals ready for input without a visual-tree reload gap.
- Durable workspace topology and per-terminal working directories across app restarts; terminals use new ConPTY processes, while active Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex sessions resume through their provider CLIs.
- Ghostty-compatible colors, fonts, palettes, bundled themes, and custom themes applied consistently to existing and newly created terminals, plus a live custom accent for shell actions and settings controls.
- A responsive settings page that keeps controls within the visible width and hides the mounted terminal surface while settings are open.
- English and Simplified Chinese interface strings.
- Optional Explorer integration in the Windows 11 first-level context menu, with a classic-menu fallback on Windows 10.
- A standalone `cmux-tui.exe` and local resource CLI for terminal automation.

## Project status

The Windows GUI and local multiplexer are usable, but this fork does not provide every feature of upstream cmux.

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Native WinUI 3 GUI | Supported |
| Local workspaces, screens, panes, tabs, and terminals | Supported |
| ConPTY shell sessions | Supported |
| Native WebView2 browser panes | Supported in the WinUI GUI; requires the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime |
| Workspace topology restoration | Supported with per-terminal local working directories; processes, output, and scrollback are not restored |
| Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex sessions | Status, in-app completion/attention notifications, and provider-session resume are supported for sessions launched inside the Windows GUI; no Windows system notifications are sent |
| Local control socket and resource CLI | Supported |
| Mac client connecting to Windows over SSH | Experimental protocol-5 `remote-link --stdio`; see [SSH testing](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#mac-to-windows-ssh-iteration) |
| Windows SSH client, forwarding, enrollment, and network relay | Not supported by the Windows CLI |
| Cloud machine providers and machine agent | Not included |
| macOS and iOS applications | Not included |

Only 64-bit Windows builds using Rust's `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target are supported. There is no MSVC-ABI engine build.

| Browser | `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right` | Go back / forward |
| Browser | `Ctrl+R` or `F5` / `Ctrl+L` | Reload / focus the address bar |
| Terminal | `Ctrl+Shift+C` or `Ctrl+Insert` | Copy the selection |
| Terminal | `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+Shift+V`, or `Shift+Insert` | Paste |
| Terminal | `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Select all |

Terminal applications continue to receive any valid Unicode character from direct keyboard layouts, dead-key composition, AltGr, Windows input methods, and supplementary-plane input such as emoji and extended CJK, plus `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, Windows/Super, function, navigation, numpad, system, international, and punctuation keys that do not exactly match an application shortcut. Switching between an English layout and an IME does not require refocusing the terminal. Application shortcuts work from terminal and WebView content, while text fields, Settings, and modal dialogs retain their own input.

## Install

1. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/sweetcornna/cmux-for-windows/releases/latest).
2. Download `cmux-windows-v<version>-setup.exe` and its matching `.sha256` file.
3. Verify the download in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   $setup = ".\cmux-windows-v<version>-setup.exe"
   $expected = (Get-Content "$setup.sha256").Trim().ToLowerInvariant()
   $actual = (Get-FileHash $setup -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLowerInvariant()
   if ($actual -ne $expected) { throw "SHA-256 mismatch" }
   ```

4. Run the installer.

The installer is per-user, installs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\cmux`, and does not require administrator privileges. Public Setup executables are currently unsigned, so Windows may show an unknown-publisher warning. Verify the SHA-256 value before continuing.

To register the Windows 11 first-level Explorer command without converting the application to MSIX, Setup installs a signed sparse identity package and trusts only its public signing certificate in the current user's `TrustedPeople` store. Setup removes an obsolete `cmux.Windows` full development MSIX during migration so Windows Search has only the installed shortcut, and that shortcut and the Explorer fallbacks reference the standalone upstream cmux icon explicitly. Uninstall removes the sparse package and that current-user certificate. Upgrades preserve settings and workspace data; uninstalling preserves that user data deliberately.

## Run the TUI

The standalone multiplexer and resource CLI use the same Windows engine:

```powershell
.\cmux-tui.exe
.\cmux-tui.exe --headless --session work
.\cmux-tui.exe --session work workspace create --name api
.\cmux-tui.exe --session work terminal list
```

The default shell is the first executable found from `pwsh.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. In the Windows GUI, `claude`, `opencode`, and `codex` launched from terminal panes preserve their complete command-line arguments and receive per-invocation local status hooks. cmux does not modify the providers' global user configuration and does not collect prompts, assistant responses, or terminal contents.

## Build from source

Clone with the Ghostty submodule:

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sweetcornna/cmux-for-windows.git
Set-Location cmux-for-windows
```

Build the Rust engine and GUI:

```powershell
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml -p cmux-ffi --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --locked
dotnet build .\windows\CmuxGui\CmuxGui.csproj -c Debug -r win-x64
```

The complete toolchain and the GNU-host linker requirement are documented in [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

For iteration builds without installing the Windows toolchain locally, run the [`Windows` GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/cmux-tui.yml) manually and download its seven-day `cmux-windows-iteration-<commit>` artifact. It contains the standalone `cmux-tui.exe` and `cmux_ffi.dll`; the workflow does not produce the signed public installer.

## Data and diagnostics

| Purpose | Location |
| --- | --- |
| GUI settings | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cmux\gui-settings.json` |
| Workspace state | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cmux-tui\sessions` |
| TUI configuration | `%APPDATA%\cmux\cmux-tui.json` |
| GUI diagnostic log | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cmux-gui.log` |
| Control sockets | `%TEMP%\cmux-tui-<user>` |

Terminal keystrokes and pasted text are intentionally never written to the diagnostic log.

Only one cmux process owns the workspace state at a time. A second launch hands its work to the running window; a launch started while the previous window is still shutting down waits for that handover. When a session cannot be opened at all, cmux reports the reason and the log path instead of exiting without a window.

## Relationship to upstream

This fork is derived from [manaflow-ai/cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) and retains the applicable copyright notices and license terms. Terminal parsing and state come from the repository's Ghostty submodule, which is derived from [ghostty-org/ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty); the Windows GUI renders that state with DirectWrite/Direct2D.

The name “cmux” identifies the software lineage. It does not imply that Manaflow or the upstream maintainers publish or support these Windows builds. Bugs in this fork should be reported in this repository, not to the upstream project.

## License

The repository is distributed under the terms and scope described in [LICENSE](LICENSE). The Rust workspace manifests retain their inherited MIT declarations; this fork does not claim to relicense code beyond the rights established by upstream history and file-level notices. Third-party components retain their own terms; see [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md) and [Upstream provenance](UPSTREAM.md).
