# Development

This guide describes the supported Windows development environment for the native GUI, Rust engine, and standalone TUI.

## Supported environment

- 64-bit Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or newer.
- Rust 1.91 or newer with the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target.
- Zig 0.16.0, matching the version required by the Ghostty submodule.
- MinGW-w64 GCC using the MSVCRT environment.
- LLVM/Clang with `libclang` available to bindgen.
- .NET 8 SDK.
- Git with submodule support.
- Visual Studio Build Tools with the x64 C++ toolset and Windows 10/11 SDK when building Explorer integration, the installer, or the development MSIX.
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime when exercising native browser panes.
- Inno Setup 6 or 7 only when building the public installer.

The Rust engine has a GNU ABI even when the host Rust toolchain uses MSVC. Do not change the target to `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`: Ghostty's Zig-built static library and the Rust artifact would use incompatible ABIs.

## Clone

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sweetcornna/cmux-for-windows.git
Set-Location cmux-for-windows
git submodule update --init --depth 1 ghostty
```

The only required submodule is `ghostty`.

## Install the Rust target

```powershell
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

A standard MSVC-host Rust installation can cross-build the GNU target. A GNU-host installation avoids Visual Studio for Rust compilation but needs the linker workaround described below.

Make sure MinGW and libclang are discoverable. A typical GitHub Actions/MSYS2 path is:

```powershell
$env:Path = "C:\msys64\mingw64\bin;$env:Path"
```

## Build the engine

From the repository root:

```powershell
cargo build --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml `
  -p cmux-tui -p cmux-ffi `
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu `
  --locked
```

`ghostty-vt-sys` invokes Zig and bindgen automatically. The build produces:

- `cmux-tui\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\debug\cmux-tui.exe`
- `cmux-tui\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\debug\cmux_ffi.dll`

### GNU-host linker failure

On a `windows-gnu` Rust host, rustc can delegate final linking to an external MinGW GCC and fail with `___chkstk_ms` relocation errors. Force Rust's bundled linker components for each final artifact:

```powershell
cargo rustc --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml `
  -p cmux-ffi `
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu `
  -- -C link-self-contained=y

cargo rustc --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml `
  -p cmux-tui --bin cmux-tui `
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu `
  -- -C link-self-contained=y
```

The MSVC-host CI runner cross-builds the GNU target and does not require these explicit flags.

### Remote build identity

`cmux-remote/build.rs` records the Git source identity automatically. Source archives can
set `CMUX_TUI_BUILD_COMMIT` explicitly. The current iteration workflow pins
`CMUX_TUI_BUILD_COMMIT` and `CMUX_TUI_DISTRIBUTION_VERSION` to the compatibility
identity expected by the tested Mac client (cmux 0.65.2, bundled TUI revision
`a9b104f3cb7d3808cf7eb5ae08b4819333b25870`). This is a Windows compatibility
build, not a claim that the fork has identical source. The artifact name and
Actions run's head SHA identify the actual Windows source revision. Updating the
Mac client requires rechecking this compatibility target and the full SSH flow.

### bindgen cannot find standard headers

`BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS` is parsed with shell quoting rules. Use forward slashes even in Windows paths:

```powershell
$env:BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS = @(
  "--target=x86_64-w64-mingw32"
  "-isystem C:/msys64/mingw64/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/<version>/include"
  "-isystem C:/msys64/mingw64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include"
) -join " "
```

A corrupted or incomplete header path usually appears as `fatal error: 'stddef.h' file not found`.

## Build and run the GUI

Build the debug `cmux_ffi.dll` first, then build the unpackaged WinUI application:

```powershell
dotnet build .\windows\CmuxGui\CmuxGui.csproj -c Debug -r win-x64
```

Run the generated `CmuxGui.exe` from the matching `bin\Debug\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64` directory. The project copies the debug engine next to the application when it exists.

The GUI is self-contained with respect to Windows App SDK. It does not depend on the machine's installed Windows App Runtime version.

### Build the Windows 11 Explorer command

The first-level Windows 11 context menu uses the native x64 `IExplorerCommand` server under `windows\CmuxShellExtension`. From a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell:

```powershell
msbuild .\windows\CmuxShellExtension\CmuxShellExtension.vcxproj `
  /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
```

`windows\scripts\package.ps1` and `windows\scripts\installer.ps1` build this project automatically. An ordinary unpackaged GUI build can still register the classic Explorer verbs, but the first-level Windows 11 command requires either the development MSIX or the signed sparse package produced for the Inno installer.

## Run the TUI and local CLI

```powershell
.\cmux-tui\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\debug\cmux-tui.exe
.\cmux-tui\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\debug\cmux-tui.exe --headless --session dev
.\cmux-tui\target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\debug\cmux-tui.exe --session dev workspace create --name test
```

The default session is `main`. The GUI uses the `cmux-gui` session.

## Test

Run formatting, the Windows binaries, focused core tests, and the WinUI build:

```powershell
cargo fmt --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml --all -- --check

cargo build --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml `
  -p cmux-tui -p cmux-ffi `
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu `
  --locked

cargo test --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml `
  -p ghostty-vt --lib `
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu `
  --locked `
  key::tests::chord_parser_encodes_common_keys

cargo test --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml `
  -p cmux-tui-core --lib `
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu `
  --locked `
  workspace_registry::tests::

cargo test --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml `
  -p cmux-tui-core --lib `
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu `
  --locked `
  persistent_gui_restart_restores_terminal_cwds_and_agent_sessions

dotnet run --project .\windows\CmuxGui.ShortcutTests\CmuxGui.ShortcutTests.csproj -c Release

dotnet build .\windows\CmuxGui\CmuxGui.csproj -c Debug -r win-x64
```

The full inherited Rust test suite is not a supported Windows gate. Some retained core test modules still hard-code `/bin/sh` and `/tmp`, and ConPTY does not yet have complete automated coverage.

### GitHub Actions iteration binaries

The [`Windows` workflow](../.github/workflows/cmux-tui.yml) runs on `windows-latest` and can be started with `workflow_dispatch`. After the Rust build, it uploads a `cmux-windows-iteration-<commit>` artifact containing `cmux-tui.exe` and `cmux_ffi.dll` for seven days. Download that artifact from the workflow run when testing a Windows target without installing the Rust, Zig, or WinUI toolchains locally. The artifact is an iteration build, not the signed public installer.

### Mac-to-Windows SSH iteration

Use this loop for the Windows VDI port; local Rust, Zig, and .NET installation is
unnecessary:

1. Commit and push the code, then dispatch `.github/workflows/cmux-tui.yml`.
   Inspect the run for the exact commit, including the SSH stdio mux bridge
   test, workspace tests, and WinUI build.
2. Download the `cmux-windows-iteration-<commit>` artifact **on `macbookair`**.
   The Air's network is preferable for the large artifact. This is an Air-side
   download followed by a separate Air-side transfer, not local SCP with a jump
   host. If Air's `gh` authentication is unavailable, use authenticated `gh` on
   the development Mac to resolve the artifact's temporary download URL, then
   pass only that URL to Air's `curl`; do not copy the GitHub token.
3. On Air, extract the archive and compute `shasum -a 256 cmux-tui.exe`.
   Use Air's `scp -O` to copy the executable to
   `vdi:C:/Users/User/.local/bin/cmux-tui.exe`. Stop the preceding test's remote
   process before replacing its executable, since Windows holds running images
   open. Stop the Mac-side carrier keeper first (`pgrep -f 'remote ssh vdi'`),
   or the client immediately reconnects and bootstraps its bundled daemon into
   that path, re-locking the executable mid-swap. With the keeper stopped, one
   remote-side PowerShell command can kill the Windows processes and move the
   new executable into place atomically; overwrite-in-place intermittently
   fails with access denied, so move a fresh filename instead. `cmux_ffi.dll`
   is needed only for native GUI testing.
4. Verify the VDI executable with `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256`. The digest
   must match Air's. Invoke `~/.local/bin/cmux-tui remote-probe --json` through
   SSH to confirm the deployed binary answers.
5. From the Mac, test the bundled `cmux-tui ssh vdi --headless --json` and then
   the actual `cmux ssh vdi` GUI command. A connection snapshot proves the
   handshake only. Acceptance also requires the GUI workspace to connect,
   open a Windows terminal, and execute a command there. Record run/commit,
   digest, connection state, and diagnostic errors; do not record screen
   contents, terminal input, or credentials.

The experimental server starts a local `--headless` mux on demand. That owner is
spawned with `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` (falling back to a plain detached spawn
when the surrounding job forbids breakaway) because Win32-OpenSSH confines each
session to a kill-on-close job object: without the escape, the owner, its
relays, and every remote terminal die with the SSH carrier, and reconnects
rebuild an empty owner while Mac surfaces stay bound to dead PTYs. With the
escape, the owner and its terminals survive carrier loss, the Mac client
re-establishes the carrier, reconnects reuse the live owner, and terminal
memory (for example shell variables) survives, matching Mac-to-Mac behavior.
Windows mux control travels through a `relay --socket` child with asynchronous
stdio pipes because the local `uds_windows` transport is synchronous; those
relays are per-connection bridges and are expected to be recreated on
reconnect. Remote state defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/cmux/remote/sessions/<session>`;
mux startup diagnostics go to `mux.log` there. It uses one SSH carrier for all
lanes, matching `cmux ssh`'s default. Independent carrier lanes and remote
daemon administration are not yet implemented by this foreground server. The
Mac's shell integration and optional remote features require separate Windows
compatibility work. An owner lost to a Windows reboot or crash is restarted by
the next carrier: it rehydrates the durable topology, and each persisted
terminal tab is materialized on first access through resource routing or the
control-path attach resolution a reconnecting client uses — the same semantics
as the Windows GUI restart, a fresh ConPTY with the restored working directory
and provider resume argv, without old processes, output, or scrollback.

The Mac frontend's fixed `/bin/sh -c 'exec "${SHELL:-/bin/sh}" -l'` default-shell
bootstrap maps to the Windows shell search order (`pwsh.exe`, `powershell.exe`,
then `cmd.exe`). Other explicit command argv are preserved.

The executable integration gate is:

```powershell
cargo test --manifest-path .\cmux-tui\Cargo.toml -p cmux-tui `
  --test remote_link --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --locked
```

For GUI changes, manually verify:

1. Create, rename, reorder, switch, and close workspaces. Exercise `Ctrl+Shift+N`, `Ctrl+Shift+PageUp/PageDown`, `Ctrl+Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+0`, `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up/Down`, `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F2`, and `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W`; confirm the selected workspace terminal accepts input immediately without an extra click.
2. Create, rename, switch, and close screens with `Ctrl+Alt+N`, `Ctrl+Alt+PageUp/PageDown`, `Ctrl+Alt+1` through `Ctrl+Alt+0`, `Ctrl+Alt+F2`, and `Ctrl+Alt+W`; confirm each screen exposes its own pane topology.
3. Split panes with `Ctrl+Shift+\\` and `Ctrl+Shift+-`, drag split and viewport dividers, repeatedly click each terminal body and confirm immediate input reaches only that pane, move focus by mouse and `Ctrl+Alt+Arrow`, toggle zoom with `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`, rename with `Ctrl+Shift+F2`, and close with `Ctrl+Shift+W`. Confirm these application shortcuts work immediately after pane, tab, and workspace switches and are not sent to the shell. Hold each destructive shortcut and confirm it executes only once. Repeat split → zoom → unzoom → close cycles and confirm terminal glyphs retain their normal aspect ratio and repaint at the final pane size.
4. Run a complex TUI such as Claude Code and verify box drawing, inverse-video controls, bold/italic text, CJK, emoji, combining characters, and one- and two-cell glyphs stay on the terminal grid. Generate enough output for scrollback, then use a standard wheel and a high-precision touchpad to move toward older and newer output; hold Shift while a TUI has mouse reporting enabled and confirm local scrollback still moves. Exercise block, bar, underline, hollow, steady, and blinking cursors; a block cursor over text must keep the glyph readable. Move the window between displays at 100%, 150%, and 200% scaling and confirm glyphs, pointer hit testing, and ConPTY rows/columns remain aligned.
5. Create, rename, reorder, move between panes, focus, and close terminal and browser tabs. Exercise `Ctrl+T`, `Ctrl+Shift+T`, `Ctrl+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+0`, `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left/Right`, `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+0`, `Ctrl+F2`, and `Ctrl+W`. Switch terminal tabs repeatedly, wait across a topology-polling interval, and confirm the selected terminal still accepts keyboard input without an extra click.
6. Exercise press, repeat, and release handling on the main keyboard and numpad; verify terminal input using left and right `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, and Windows/Super, CapsLock/NumLock state, function and navigation keys, PrintScreen, ScrollLock, Pause, the menu key, the international backslash key, and OEM punctuation such as `Ctrl+[`, `Ctrl+]`, `Ctrl+/`, and `Ctrl+\\`. Verify Right Alt/AltGr still produces layout text instead of being encoded as `Ctrl+Alt`; switch between an English layout and Chinese or another installed IME in the same focused terminal; verify ASCII, accented text, dead-key composition, AltGr, BMP CJK, supplementary CJK, and emoji, then compose, select, cancel, and commit IME text, confirming only committed text reaches the shell and the candidate window follows the cursor. Test `Ctrl+Shift+C`, `Ctrl+Insert`, `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Shift+Insert`, and `Ctrl+Shift+A`; type into PowerShell and `cmd.exe`, verify selection colors and soft wraps, paste with and without bracketed-paste mode, and confirm Shift forces local selection when terminal mouse reporting is enabled.
7. In browser content and the address bar, exercise `Alt+Left/Right`, `Ctrl+R`, `F5`, `Ctrl+L`, and the workspace/screen/pane/tab shortcuts. Navigate through a redirect and verify the document title reaches the tab. Confirm typing and editing remain local in the address bar, workspace search, Settings, and every modal dialog, and that an unavailable WebView2 Runtime produces a visible browser error rather than closing the workspace.
8. Put terminals in different local directories, run `claude --version`, `opencode --version`, and `codex --version`, then start Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex sessions and restart the main application. Confirm provider options reach the real executables, and workspace, screen, pane, tab, layout, focus, names, browser URLs, per-terminal directories, and provider sessions are restored with new ConPTY processes and fresh WebView controls. Terminal output, scrollback, arbitrary commands, page state, and browser history must not be restored. Confirm working/needs-attention/done status appears, completion and attention produce a notification only inside the cmux window, no Windows system notification is sent, typing continues without another click when the notification appears or is dismissed, and the in-app focus action selects the exact workspace, screen, pane, and tab.
9. Launch a second new-workspace activation and confirm it is forwarded to the existing main window. Launch a new-window activation and confirm it uses an independent transient mux whose topology is not restored later.
10. Change appearance, theme, font, language, background, opacity, and Explorer-integration settings. Confirm the settings surface does not reveal terminal output underneath it. Confirm terminal foreground/background overrides and full theme palettes update existing visible and hidden terminals, then create another terminal and confirm it inherits the same colors. Select Follow config or reset the overrides and confirm existing terminals immediately return to the Ghostty configuration baseline; also confirm the accent picker immediately updates the new-workspace action, settings sliders, and project link.
11. Leave terminal and browser panes idle across multiple topology-polling intervals and confirm the controls do not flash or reconstruct; confirm every screen and pane action is uniformly 30 × 30 DIP with a complete centered icon at normal and narrow window sizes, and that changing pane focus does not add an accent-colored outer border.
12. Enable Explorer integration and confirm both “Open in new cmux window” and “Open in new cmux workspace” appear directly in the Windows 11 menu for a filesystem folder. Launch each command and confirm its selected terminal accepts keyboard input immediately without an extra click; disable integration and confirm both commands disappear. On Windows 10, verify the classic fallbacks instead.
13. Inspect only diagnostics and persisted agent events produced during the acceptance run and confirm they contain no terminal key events, character events, pasted text, prompts, assistant responses, tool payloads, credentials, or terminal screen content.

## Windows portability rules

- Use `platform::sync_directory()` instead of opening a directory as a file.
- Release open handles before deleting or replacing files and directories.
- Put platform path, shell, permission, and synchronization decisions in `cmux-tui-core::platform`.
- Gate tests that reference Unix-only items at the test itself.
- Keep the core registry authoritative; frontends reconcile from core snapshots after mutations.
- Treat all terminal input and output as sensitive. Do not add content logging to diagnostics.
